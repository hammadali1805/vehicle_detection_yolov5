# Vehicle Detection Project

This project focuses on vehicle detection using the YOLO v5 architecture, combining the power of computer vision and machine learning. The objective is to accurately detect and classify various vehicle types from videos, making it a practical tool for applications such as traffic monitoring and autonomous driving systems.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've utilized the YOLO v5 architecture for its speed and accuracy in real-time object detection. The model has been trained using the RoboFlow dataset, which contains a diverse set of vehicle images, including cars, buses, motorcycles, ambulances, and trucks.

### Project Highlights

- **YOLO v5 Architecture**: Leveraged this state-of-the-art model for efficient vehicle detection.
- **Dataset**: Trained on the RoboFlow dataset comprising 627 images of various vehicle classes.
- **Web Application**: Developed a user-friendly webpage allowing users to upload videos for vehicle detection. This involved creating Flask APIs for seamless interaction with the model.

### Skills Acquired

Through this project, I have gained:

- In-depth understanding of the YOLO architecture and its applications in real-world scenarios.
- Enhanced knowledge of computer vision and object detection techniques.
- Hands-on experience with training and evaluating machine learning models.
- Proficiency in developing and deploying APIs using Flask for model interaction.
